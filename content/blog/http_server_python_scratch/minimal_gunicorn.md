The [simple HTTP server we built previously]({{< relref "introduction.md#setting-the-stage-for-building-our-own-http-server" >}}) was a great starting point, but it's limited when it comes to handling concurrent connections. Enter [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org)â€”a renowned WSGI HTTP server designed for serving Python applications. In this article, I'll craft a stripped-down version of Gunicorn, delving into the intricacies of the [Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html) and the art of asynchronous connection management, both essential for modern web applications.

## Part I: Why Go Beyond Basic HTTP?

- Discuss the shortcomings of a basic HTTP server
- Express the need for WSGI compliance and asynchronous handling in modern web applications

## Part II: WSGI: The Building Block

- Briefly explain the WSGI specification and why it's important
- Metaphor: Compare WSGI to a universal plug adapter, enabling various web frameworks and servers to work seamlessly

## Part III: Laying the Foundation

- Outline the prerequisites and the Python libraries that will be used
- Describe the starting point: the simplistic HTTP server developed in previous articles
- Code Snippet: Basic WSGI-compliant application setup

## Part IV: Building the WSGI Handler

- Step-by-step guide on writing the WSGI handler for our server
- Code Examples: WSGI handler function, how it fits into the existing server architecture
- Explain why each step is important and how it aligns with WSGI standards

## Part V: Introducing Asynchronous Handling

- Discuss the challenges of handling multiple connections sequentially
- Introduce asynchronous handling as a solution
- Code Snippet: Implementing basic multi-threading or asynchronous IO to handle connections

## Part VI: The Gunicorn-esque Touch

- Talk about features that give Gunicorn its robustness, like worker processes and graceful shutdown
- Code Examples: Implement a simplistic version of worker processes, graceful shutdown mechanics
- Discuss the considerations and trade-offs made to keep the server minimal

## Part VII: Testing and Performance Benchmarks

- Guide on how to test the server for WSGI compliance and connection handling
- Share performance metrics comparing the basic HTTP server, the WSGI-compliant server, and the Gunicorn-like server

## Conclusion

- Recap the process of going from a basic HTTP server to something much more powerful
- Reflect on the importance of understanding the technologies we use at a deeper level
- Encourage readers to add their own optimizations and share findings

## Additional Resources

- Suggested articles, documentation, and libraries for further learning
