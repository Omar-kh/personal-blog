I am Omar, a Software Engineer with a decade of hands-on experience in the tech world.

Rooted deeply in my journey is the philosophy that "Nothing is permanent but change." This belief shapes my approach to life and technology, making me a forever student in this ever-evolving world of tech. Keeping close to heart the thought "All I know is I know nothing," I tread with humility and wonder.

Armed with an M.Eng in Signal and Information Processing, I've navigated diverse roles. I began in IT security, expanded to full-stack development, and eventually delved deep into the nuances of backend engineering and data pipeline construction.

While my current main stack includes Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL, I've had the opportunity to dabble in various technologies, such as Typescript, Vue.js, Nest.js, and many others. I do, however, believe that tech is as much about people as it is about code. Beyond the technical, it's the bonds formed in collaborative projects, the "aha!" moments in problem-solving, and the joy of turning a concept into a working product that keep me driven.

Beyond the lines of code, I'm often engaged in the delightful chaos of parenting a spirited toddler. It's a role where 'debugging' involves figuring out the mystery behind sudden giggles or the all-too-silent room â€” a fun challenge in its own right! Outside, I'm drawn to nature, appreciating its tranquility, and I enjoy taking strolls, whether amidst the city's hustle or the calm of a wooded trail. And while coding can be a solo endeavor at times, there's nothing like the camaraderie of leisure time spent with family and friends, laughing and making memories.
