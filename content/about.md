I am Omar, a Software Engineer with a decade of hands-on experience in the tech world.

Rooted deeply in my journey is the philosophy that "Nothing is permanent but change." This belief shapes my approach to life and technology, making me a forever student in this ever-evolving world of tech. Keeping close to heart the thought "All I know is I know nothing," I tread with humility and wonder.

Armed with an M.Eng in Signal and Information Processing, I've navigated diverse roles. I began in IT security, expanded to full-stack development, and eventually delved deep into the nuances of backend engineering and data pipeline construction.

While my current main stack includes Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL, I've had the opportunity to dabble in various technologies, such as Typescript, Vue.js, Nest.js, and many others. I do, however, believe that tech is as much about people as it is about code. Beyond the technical, I cherish the bonds formed in collaborative projects, the "aha!" moments in problem-solving, and the sheer joy of watching an idea blossom into reality.

Between all the coding and projects, I often turn to timeless wisdom and the simple joys of life for balance. To me, every challenge is a new lesson, every project a fresh journey, and every piece of code a story waiting to unfold. In this ever-changing ride, I'm always open and curious, looking forward to what's next.
